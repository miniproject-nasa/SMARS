# Hardware Codes

This folder contains the **hardware-related Python codes** and the **circuit diagram** for our project.

Our project is an **assistive tool for memory patients**, developed using a combination of **hardware and software**. The hardware part focuses on device-level operations and interaction, while the Python codes handle hardware control and communication with the software system.

## Contents
- Python scripts for hardware operation
